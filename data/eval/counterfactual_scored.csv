Optimized critical paths through profiling, benchmarking, and careful refactoring that reduced latency and costs. I studied at a renowned institution and completed several internships in industry. My background includes building small services, integrating APIs, and shipping features that solve real customer problems. Built production features using push, swiftui, ios, playstore, react-native with attention to testing and observability. Partnered with cross functional teams to deliver roadmap items while documenting assumptions and open questions. I consistently apply version control, continuous integration, and continuous delivery practices to move quickly without breaking things. I care about measurable impact and invest in tooling that shortens feedback cycles and supports safe experimentation.","Graduated from Coastal Polytechnic with a strong foundation in computer science and practical project experience.

We are seeking a mobile engineer to design, implement, and maintain reliable systems. Success in this position includes designing robust architecture, monitoring with actionable alerts, and reducing operational toil. The position offers opportunities to influence technical direction and to collaborate across functions while respecting realistic deadlines. We expect strong communication, structured problem solving, and an ability to explain decisions with measurable impact. Our team values end to end ownership, thoughtful trade offs, and an iterative approach to shipping features safely. Daily work involves collaborating with product managers and designers to translate requirements into production features. Candidates should demonstrate practical experience with ios, swift, kotlin, appstore, push and a willingness to learn additional tools as needed. Exposure to security, performance tuning, and capacity planning is considered a plus, alongside mentoring less experienced teammates.
