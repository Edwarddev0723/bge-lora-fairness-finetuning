My responsibilities have included performing code reviews for common vulnerabilities, working with developers to implement secure authentication flows, and collaborating with operations teams to tighten network access controls. I am familiar with threat modeling, security monitoring tools, and coordinating incident response when suspicious activity is detected. While I am not a penetration tester by trade, I have run targeted tests on critical components and guided remediation efforts. In cross-functional projects, I focus on balancing risk reduction with realistic constraints on engineering time and product deadlines.","We are hiring an application security engineer to focus on improving the security posture of our customer-facing web and mobile products. The role involves partnering closely with product teams during design and implementation, reviewing code and architecture for vulnerabilities, and building guardrails such as secure libraries and automated checks in CI pipelines. While you will collaborate with infrastructure security and incident response, the majority of your time will be spent working alongside developers to help them ship secure features efficiently.
